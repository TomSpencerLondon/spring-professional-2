# Module 02: AOP Concepts

## Introduction
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm in Spring that complements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It addresses cross-cutting concerns in a modular way, enhancing code maintainability and readability.

## Key Concepts

### What is AOP?
AOP allows developers to inject behaviors into existing code without modifying it. It separates cross-cutting concerns, such as logging or security, from business logic.

#### Core Components:
- **Join Point**: A point in program execution where additional behavior can be applied (e.g., method execution).
- **Pointcut**: A predicate that matches Join Points.
- **Advice**: The action taken at a matched Join Point (e.g., logging).
- **Aspect**: Combines Pointcuts and Advices, representing a concern.
- **Weaving**: The process of applying aspects to the target code.

### Common Cross-Cutting Concerns
1. Logging
2. Performance Monitoring
3. Transactions
4. Security
5. Caching
6. Exception Handling

---

### Benefits of AOP
1. **Reduces Code Duplication**: Eliminates repeated code for similar functionalities across layers.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps business logic clean and focused.
3. **Improves Maintainability**: Easier to update cross-cutting concerns.

---

### AOP Implementation in Spring
Spring uses runtime weaving through proxies:
1. **JDK Dynamic Proxies**: For interfaces.
2. **CGLIB Proxies**: For classes without interfaces.

#### Limitations:
- Proxies do not support self-invocation.
- JDK Proxies require public methods in interfaces.
- CGLIB Proxies do not support final classes or methods.

### Advice Types in Spring
1. **@Before**: Executes before the matched Join Point.
    - Use: Logging, validation.
2. **@After**: Executes after the matched Join Point.
    - Use: Resource cleanup.
3. **@AfterReturning**: Executes after successful execution.
    - Use: Validating return values.
4. **@AfterThrowing**: Executes when an exception is thrown.
    - Use: Error handling.
5. **@Around**: Surrounds the Join Point, allowing custom pre- and post-processing.
    - Use: Transactions, tracing.

---

### Enabling AOP in Spring
1. Add `@EnableAspectJAutoProxy` to a configuration class.
2. Define aspects as Spring Beans using `@Component`.

---

### Example Pointcut Expressions
1. **Execution**: Matches method execution.
   ```java
   execution(* com.example..*Service.*(..))
   ```
2. **Within**: Matches types within a package.
   ```java
   within(com.example..*)
   ```
3. **Annotation**: Matches annotated methods.
   ```java
   @annotation(com.example.Secured)
   ```

---

### Using `JoinPoint` and `ProceedingJoinPoint`
- **JoinPoint** provides metadata about the intercepted method (e.g., method name, arguments).
- **ProceedingJoinPoint** allows controlling the execution of the intercepted method in `@Around` advice.

## Example Code Snippet

### Aspect Definition
```java
@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {

    @Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void logBeforeMethodExecution(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("Before executing: " + joinPoint.getSignature());
    }

    @Around("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public Object logAroundMethodExecution(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("Before: " + joinPoint.getSignature());
        Object result = joinPoint.proceed();
        System.out.println("After: " + joinPoint.getSignature());
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Enabling AOP
```java
@Configuration
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example")
public class AppConfig {
}
```
